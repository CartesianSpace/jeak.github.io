<p>I'm an undergraduate seeking a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.</p>

<p>Originally from the University City area of San Diego, I lived in Claremont, CA for a few years until moving back to SD. Now, I'm living in beautiful San Luis Obispo! I'm interested in many things, including electronics, making things, <a href="http://qrz.com/db/kk6ywg">amateur radio</a>>, and much more!</p>

<p>If you're a <del>recruiter</del> interested individual, you're much better off checking <a href="http://calpoly.edu/~jgalle05/">my Cal Poly-hosted page</a>. I'm working on bringing these two pages together eventually, but for now, this site will be mainly a blogging platform. </p>
