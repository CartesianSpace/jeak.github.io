<p>I'm an undergraduate seeking a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.</p>

<p>Originally from the University City area of San Diego, I lived in Claremont, CA for a few years until moving back to SD. Now, I'm living in beautiful San Luis Obispo! I'm interested in many things, including electronics, making things, [amateur radio](https://qrz.com/db/kk6ywg), and much more!</p>

<p>If you're a ~~recruiter~~ interested individual, you're much better off checking [my Cal Poly-hosted web page](https://calpoly.edu/~jgalle05/). I'm working on bringing these two pages together eventually, but for now, this site will be mainly a blogging platform. </p>
